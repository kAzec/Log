`Log` is a powerful logging framework that provides built-in themes and formatters, and a nice API to define your owns.

> Get the most out of `Log` by installing [`XcodeColors`](https://github.com/robbiehanson/XcodeColors) and [`KZLinkedConsole`](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/KZLinkedConsole)

### Usage

#### The basics

- Use `Log` just as you would use `print`.

```swift
let Log = Logger()
   
Log.trace("Called!!!")
Log.debug(["Who is self: ", self])
Log.info([one, two, three])
Log.warn([one, two, three], separator: " - ")
Log.error([error], terminator: "ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±\n")
Log.fatal("Fail fast!") // @noreturn
```

- Disable `Log` by setting `enabled` to `false`:

```swift
Log.enabled = false
```

- Define a minimum level of severity to only print the messages with a greater or equal severity:

```swift
Log.level = .warning
```

> The severity levels are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error` and `fatal`.

#### Customization

- Create your own `Logger` by changing its `Theme` and/or `Formatter`.

A suggested way of doing it is by extending `Formatters` and `Themes`:

```swift
extension Formatter {
    static func named(name: String) -> Formatter {
        return Formatter("[%@] %@ | %@ [\(name)] - %@", [
            .date(format: "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS"),
            .level(equalWidth: true, align: .right),
            .location,
            .message
        ])
    }
}

extension Theme {
    static let tomorrowNight = Theme.new(
        trace:   0xC5C8C6,
        debug:   0x81A2BE,
        info:    0xB5BD68,
        warn:    0xF0C674,
        error:   0xCC6666,
        fatal:   0xFFFFFF
    ).background(
        fatal:   0xCC6666
    ).build()
}
```

Then create a new logger.

```swift
let Log = Logger(formatter: .named("Named"), theme: .tomorrowNight)
```

> See the built-in [formatters](https://github.com/kAzec/Log/blob/master/Sources/Extensions/Formatter+DefaultFormatters.swift) and [themes](https://github.com/kAzec/Log/blob/master/Sources/Extensions/Theme+DefaultThemes.swift) for more examples.

**Tip:** `Logger.format` and `Logger.colors` can be useful to visually debug your logger.

Nothing prevents you from creating as many loggers as you want!

```swift
let basic = Logger(formatter: .concise, theme: nil)
let minimal = Logger(level: .info, formatter: .minimal, theme: .flat)
```

- Turn off the colors by setting the theme to `nil`:

```swift
Log.theme = nil
```

## Installation

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Log into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "kAzec/Log"
```
